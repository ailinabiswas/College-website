    <p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-style: italic; font-size: 120%;">The post-graduate department of Economics was formally established in 1917. Before that Economics was taught as part of History in the undergraduate level. The 1st chair in India was founded in the Economics department of the University of Calcutta in 1909. The department was called the department of Political Economy after establishment, as it also contained the seeds of the departments of Philosophy and Political Science.  In 1948, the department of Economics emerged as an independent department. It was shifted to its present campus on Barrackpore Trunk Road (B.T. Road) on September 9, 1958. The 1st batch of post-graduates in Economics under the University of Calcutta passed out from this exclusive campus in 1959. This campus, formally known as the B.T.Road campus is popularly known as Kantakol campus among the generations of its students, which got its name from the bus stop. The Ford Foundation financed the construction of the three-storied building with a four-story foundation. The carpet area is about 30,000 square feet.<br><br>There are 2500 students enrolled in Economics.</p>
